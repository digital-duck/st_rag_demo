Gong that delves into the study of Chinese characters through the lens of physics, network analysis, and natural systems. The paper presents a novel approach to understanding Chinese characters by identifying elemental characters and analyzing their structure across spatial positions. It also discusses how Chinese characters exhibit properties of natural systems, such as emergent complexity and self-organization. The research aims to simplify the complexity of the character system and transform language education through AI-assisted learning approaches.",

Gong could be:\n\n1. Identification of Elemental Characters: The research identified 422 elemental characters (元字) as fundamental building blocks of Chinese characters through computational analysis. This simplification reduces the initial memorization burden from thousands of characters to a manageable set of foundational elements.\n\n2. Physics-Inspired \"Zi-Matrix\" Model: The research utilized a physics-inspired \"Zi-Matrix\" model to analyze character structure across eleven spatial positions, revealing systematic patterns in component relationships and semantic extension. This approach provides insights into the organization and evolution of Chinese characters.\n\n3. Application of Natural Systems Principles: The research demonstrates that Chinese characters exhibit properties of natural systems, such as emergent complexity, self-organization, and adaptive resilience. By applying principles from natural systems, the study uncovers deeper patterns and richer meanings in character evolution, from simple pictographs to sophisticated abstractions.\n\nThese findings highlight the innovative approach of the research in exploring Chinese characters through interdisciplinary methods and shedding light on the underlying principles governing their structure and meaning.",

The author developed a web application called \"ZiNets\" to decompose 6190 Chinese characters, including 3910 HSK common characters, into elemental components. These elemental characters were identified based on their frequency above a defined threshold. The document discusses the evolution of Chinese characters, the structure of characters like 乍 (representing concepts of work, creation, and transformation), and the implications of understanding character structures for language learning and cognitive insights. Additionally, the document explores the fusion of human knowledge and AI in software development, physics, and the Chinese language. The author also acknowledges the collaborative effort with AI assistants like Claude 3.3 from Anthropic, Gemini 2 from Google, and Qwen2.5-Max from Alibaba.",
