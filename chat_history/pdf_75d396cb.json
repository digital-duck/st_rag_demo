Transition from Static to Dynamic Understanding of characters as a living, evolving system with clear visualization of meanings extending from concrete to abstract, adaptive capacity for new concepts, and recognition of internal logic in character evolution.\n2. Transition from Fragmented to Integrated Knowledge through the systematic classification of characters into categories like human experience, basic natural elements, flora, fauna, mathematical concepts, and abstract concepts.\n3. Educational Applications focusing on promoting concept-based learning, breaking down barriers between disciplines, making STEM-oriented learning accessible through character analysis, teaching systematic thinking, and enhancing memorization and understanding.\n4. Modern Applications such as character design principles for digital fonts, input method optimization, natural language processing models, AI applications in character recognition and generation, development of new technical terminology, and cross-cultural communication of scientific concepts.\n5. Basic Research in Other Natural Languages.",

      "content": "The document explores the evolution and structure of Chinese characters, highlighting how they represent a living, evolving system with meanings that transition from concrete to abstract. It emphasizes the adaptive capacity of characters for new concepts and the internal logic in their evolution. The study showcases how characters like Âùô encode transitions in human understanding, such as the shift from material mass to structural efficiency. It also discusses the integration of linguistic, philosophical, and scientific insights in character analysis, bridging traditional wisdom with modern analysis. The research aims to deepen understanding by moving from surface to deep structure, recognizing metaphorical thinking and systematic meaning extension. Overall, the document underscores the importance of understanding Chinese characters as a naturally evolved system that reveals underlying patterns and principles, enriching learning experiences and supporting cross-disciplinary knowledge organization.",
