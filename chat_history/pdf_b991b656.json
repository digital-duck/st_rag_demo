It is a computational network structure tool used for the spatial decomposition model of Chinese character network analysis. The application decomposes Chinese characters into a Zi-Matrix, which is an 11-component matrix representing the spatial relationships between the constituent parts of any Chinese character. This tool helps in understanding the structure of Chinese characters by breaking them down into elemental components. The author used ZiNets to decompose 6190 Chinese characters, including 3910 HSK common characters.",

In the context provided, 422 unique, irreducible components are identified as elemental characters. These components serve as the basic elements from which more complex Chinese characters are constructed.\n\nElemental characters can include traditional Kangxi radicals, basic structural elements, and frequently occurring components that carry both phonetic and semantic information. They are essential for understanding and teaching Chinese character composition as they provide a nuanced foundation while maintaining semantic integrity.\n\nThrough manual decomposition of a large number of Chinese characters, these elemental characters are identified as the most fundamental components that cannot be further divided. They are crucial in analyzing character structure and can simplify the learning process by breaking down complex characters into their elemental parts.",
