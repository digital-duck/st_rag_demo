The application of network analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) in studying Chinese characters to uncover hidden relationships and simplify the complexity of the character system.\n2. The comparison of the success of reductionism in science with the study of Chinese characters to reveal deeper patterns and meanings.\n3. The dedication to late Professor T.D. Lee and the author's parents for their contributions and support.\n4. The collaborative effort between the author and AI assistants from Anthropic, Google, and Alibaba in developing AI-enhanced learning tools for Chinese language.\n5. The exploration of physics-inspired analysis in understanding language as a complex adaptive system.\n6. The implications of the research for language education, knowledge organization, and cross-cultural communication.\n7. The transformation of language education from knowledge mastery to meaning discovery through AI-assisted learning approaches.\n8. The significance of viewing Chinese characters as a living system that reveals connections between language, thought, and natural patterns.\n9. The promise of bridging traditional wisdom with modern computational methods in language education.",
