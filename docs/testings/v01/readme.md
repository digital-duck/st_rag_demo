You're right, it's better to check the source code directly to understand the correct attribute names in the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class. Let me help you locate the source file in your conda virtual environment.

To find the source file of the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter class in your conda environment, you can:

1. Activate your conda environment first (which you've likely already done)
2. Use Python to help you locate the exact file path

Here's how to find the source file location:

```bash
# Make sure your conda environment is activated
# Then run Python with the following code

python -c "from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter; print(RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.__module__); import sys, os; print(os.path.dirname(sys.modules[RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter.__module__].__file__))"
```

C:\Users\p2p2l\anaconda3\envs\langchain\Lib\site-packages\langchain_text_splitters


This command will print:
1. The module name where RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter is defined
2. The directory path where the source file is located

Once you have this directory path, you can navigate to it and examine the file. The source file will likely be named something like `text_splitters.py` or similar within that directory.

Alternatively, you can also directly check the implementation with:

```python
python -c "from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter; import inspect; print(inspect.getsource(RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter))"
```

This will print the actual source code of the class, allowing you to see the exact attribute names being used.

After you've located the correct attribute names, you can make a more informed fix to your code. The issue is indeed in how you're accessing the chunk size configuration in the text splitter object.
